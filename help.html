		<hr>
		<p>Guess the secret word in 8 or less attempts.</p>
		<p>Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Hit the Enter button to submit.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After each guess, the three colored (green-yellow-red) tiles on the right will show you how close your guess was to the secret word.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Green/left: The number of letters that are correct and in the correct position.</li>
		<li>Yellow/middle: The number of letters that are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>
		<li>Red/right: The number of letters that are not in the secret word.</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<p class="p-bold">EXAMPLE:</p>
		<br>
		<img id="guess1" src="images/guess1.png" alt="guess1 (STARE)">
		<p>"STARE" contains 2 letters of the secret word, but in another position. 3 letters are not in the secret word.</p>
		<br>
		<img id="guess2" src="images/guess2.png" alt="guess1 (PRINT)">
		<br>
		<p>"PRINT" has one correct letter in the correct position, 2 correct letters in the wrong position. Two letters are not in the secret word.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>If you get stuck, there is the "Hint" button. Can you resist the temptation?</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Word500 can be played in many languages and 3 difficulty levels. At Standard difficulty level (green smiley) the secret word cannot have repeat letters (like OFFER) and some letters are excluded.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Every day, one new secret word is generated for each language and difficulty level. Enjoy!</p>
